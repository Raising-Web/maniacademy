        Laishram Mani Memorial <br />
        English Academy
      </h3>

      <p class="text-lg w-[80%] font-rubik py-2">
        Founded in loving memory of Late Shri Laishram Mani Singh, former Deputy
        Director of CADA and the Department of Horticulture, Government of
        Manipur, Laishram Mani Memorial English Academy stands as a beacon of
        learning and dedication at Kongba Dhobi Lampak, Imphal East.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg w-[80%] font-rubik py-2">
        What began as Christ Reign School — a humble dream of a visionary who
        believed in the power of education to transform lives — has now
        blossomed into one of the most respected educational institutions along
        the Kongba-Yairipok Road. For more than three decades, the Academy has
        been nurturing young minds with knowledge, discipline, and moral
        strength.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg w-[80%] font-rubik py-2">
        Over the years, our students have carried the school's spirit of
        excellence to the highest levels of learning. Some of our proud alumni
        are now pursuing their dreams in India's top institutions — Wahengbam
        Naothoi, pursuing a Ph.D. at IIT Bombay, and Mutum Rajesh, completing
        his M.Tech. at IISc Bangalore.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg w-[80%] font-rubik py-2">
        Their journeys stand as shining examples of what dedicated guidance,
        hard work, and strong values can achieve. They are not only the pride of
        our Academy but also living reflections of our founder's vision — to
        enlighten generations through education and purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg w-[80%] font-rubik py-2">
        At Laishram Mani Memorial English Academy, we continue to walk on this
        path — inspiring, guiding, and nurturing every learner to reach the
        height of their potential, just as our founder dreamed.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-archivo-black uppercase my-8">Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="w-[90%] text-lg font-rubik capitalize mb-10">
        To cultivate knowledge, character, and discipline, shaping responsible
        and confident citizens of tomorrow.
